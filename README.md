# Htwg Scala Seed Project 
=====================================================
## the easiest way to start a project for the lecture SE


This is a seed project to create a basic scala project as used in the
class Software Engineering at the University of Applied Science HTWG Konstanz.

It requires Java 8 on your local platform.
The project has
* a folder structure prepared for a MVC-style application
* *ScalaTest* and as dependency aswell as dependencies to other libraries in the build.sbt (commented out at start).
* *scalastyle-sbt-plugin* and *sbt-scoverage* sbt plugins
* .gitignore defaults

The easiest way to create your own project from this seed is
* create an account on github
* navigate to this project on github (https://github.com/markoboger/htwg-scala-seed)
* fork this project on github (button on top right "Fork")
* copy the URL to your fork
* clone the forked project from your local git (git clone <URL>) or IDE (IDEA: File > New > Import from Version Controll > github)

After that, please rename
* the Project name from htwg-scala-seed to <your game name>
* the the package structure from de.htwg.se.yourgame to de.htwg.se.<your game name>
* the name of the project in the build.sbt file from htwg-scala-seed to <your game name>
* the main Class YourGame to <YourGameName>

Then
* push to git
* add team partner to your project on github (Settings > Collaborators)
* clone on partners account
* push and pull back and forth
